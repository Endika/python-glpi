Python API for calling GLPI Webservices
=======================================

* What it is

  This project started a small script to enable nagios to generate
  tickets in GLPI upon alerts. Then I decided I needed a fuller
  pythonic api to my GLPI server.

* Where it is

  I'm breaking a semantic rule by including status updates in this
  README, but who cares? I'm saving you fine folks a click.

** Status Update <2012-10-17 Wed 13:20>   
   
   I've wrtten examples to test some of these methods. 

** Status Update <2012-10-08 Mon >
   Please note: as of 2012-10-08, most of these methods are untested,
   and this is completely a work in progress. I will update this
   README file or the github wiki for this project as I complete
   tests.

* Want to help?

  Anyone willing, feel free to test these APIs along with me and email
  me their results and suggestions (address is in pyglpy.py).
