Python API for calling GLPI Webservices
=======================================

This project started a small script to enable nagios to generate
tickets in GLPI upon alerts. Then I decided I needed a fuller pythonic
api to my GLPI server.

Please note: as of today, 2012-10-08, most of these methods are
untested, and this is completely a work in progress. I will update
this README file or the github wiki for this project as I complete
tests. 

Anyone willing, feel free to test these APIs along with me and email
me their results and suggestions (address is in pyglpy.py).
