Intro
=====

This is a python interface to the `GLPI webservices plugin
<http://plugins.glpi-project.org/spip.php?article94>`_. It depends
heavily on JSON, urllib and urllib2. Requires python 2.7. Also, has
only been tested with v.1.3.0 of the GLPI webservices plugin.
                                                                                                              
This documentation, with few ammendments, has been lifted (without
permission) almost ver batim from `the webservices documentation
available here
<https://forge.indepnet.net/projects/webservices/wiki/En_devguide>`_.

Thanks so much to all the awesome developers that have made the
webservices plugin and GLPI so useful.
